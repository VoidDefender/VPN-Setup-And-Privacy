# VPN Benefits and Limitations

## Benefits Observed:

- IP address changed, indicating tunneling success
- DNS requests were encrypted and routed
- Geo-restricted content was accessible
- ISPs and public Wi-Fi providers could not track visited websites

---

## Limitations Observed:

- Bandwidth dropped approximately 40â€“50% after connection
- Increased latency in browsing and downloads
- Free servers had occasional disconnections
- Some services flagged VPN and required CAPTCHAs

---

## Conclusion:

VPN improves privacy significantly for public networks and casual browsing, but introduces performance trade-offs and may not bypass all content filters.
